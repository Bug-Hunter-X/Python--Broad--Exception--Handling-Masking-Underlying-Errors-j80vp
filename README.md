This repository demonstrates an example of an uncommon error in Python code, where a too-broad 'Exception' clause masks underlying issues that might arise from external libraries or other modules.

The bug lies in the overly broad exception handling, hindering the identification of specific issues.

The solution involves improving the error handling by catching specific exceptions and re-raising the general exception for handling outside the function scope.
